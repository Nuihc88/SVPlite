Below are links to filter versions i use myself and can recommend for use with SVPlite scripts, but due to legal reasons can't pre-package with SVPlite...
Most of the time your choice of version won't matter much, but you could get slightly better performance or less overhead using the ones specified below:

AviSynth+ shebang_mod v3.7.2 based build:                           (Least overhead and latency)

OR
AviSynth+ r3218 v3.5.2 2020.04.28 test build:              (Least likely to return incorrect frames)

SVPflow1.dll is from:
32bit: https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.svp-team.com/files/repo/full/core.flow32/4.5.0.202plugins.7z
64bit: https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.svp-team.com/files/repo/full/core.flow64/4.5.0.206plugins64.7z
SVPflow2.dll is from:
32bit:	https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.svp-team.com/files/repo/full/core.flow32/4.3.0.160plugins.7z
64bit:	https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.svp-team.com/files/repo/full/core.flow64/4.3.0.161plugins64.7z
Note: Newer SVPflow2.dll versions require official SVP to be running in the background, so if portability is a factor you'll need to use these older versions.

Note: C++17 builds are more standards compliant and thus possibly more stable or reliable; C++20 builds required a compiler workaround, but might be better optimized.
