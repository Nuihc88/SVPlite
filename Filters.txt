Below are links to filter versions that i'm currently using with SVPlite scripts...
Most of the time, your choice of version won't matter much, but you could get slightly better performance using the ones specified below:

64bit: https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.svp-team.com/files/repo/full/core.flow64/4.5.0.206plugins64.7z

SVPflow2.dll is from:
32bit:	https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.svp-team.com/files/repo/full/core.flow32/4.3.0.160plugins.7z
64bit:	https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.svp-team.com/files/repo/full/core.flow64/4.3.0.161plugins64.7z

Note: Newer SVPflow2.dll versions require official SVP to be running in the background, so if portability is a factor you'll need to use these older versions.
