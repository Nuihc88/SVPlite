Extra Performance Tweak #1: Make sure that everything in your filter chain is using the same colorspace eg. NV12;
check LAV Filters, AviSynth Filter, Internal Video Transform Filters & any other video filters in your chain;
confirm using your renderer's diagnostic output, one by one, that each filter is indeed outputting the right thing.
